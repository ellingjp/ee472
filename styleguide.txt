This is a poorly written and incomplete styleguide.  Feel free to change
this with your preferred style.  After project 0, this should not change.

This should serve to keep a consistent style between authors.

WHITESPACE:
  - no tabs, use spaces
  - tabstops at 2, eg

      int main() {
        if (x)
          do something;
      }

VARIABLE NAMES:
  - camel case, eg 'varName'
  - when declaring pointers, asterisk should be next to variable name, ex:
      int *myPtr;

    This is particularly nice when declaring several pointers:

      int *myPtr, *anotherPtr; as opposed to
      int* myPtr, * anotherPtr;

BLOCKS:
  - open curly braces on same line, eg

        int function() {
          // some function
        }

COMMENTS:
    - Multiline comments for functions, single line comments elsewhere

        /*
        * This function has some functionality
        */
        int function() {
          if (x)  // do something if x
            do something;
        }

        /* this function is private to this file */
        static int function() {
          int val = something;
          return val;   // return val
        }

MULTIPLE FILE PROGRAMS:
    - Public data should be DECLARED in header files (.h), for example
        "GlobalData" struct and "extern GlobalData globalDataMem"

    - Private data should be declared in c files, for example
        MeasureData (exclusively used by measure.c) should be declared 
        in measure.c, not measure.h

    - DEFINITIONS go into c files (.c), for example 
        "GlobalData globalDataMem = { ... }" 


    Note that globalDataMem is defined in globals.c, but is declared in
    globals.h as "extern ..." so the variable has external linkage
