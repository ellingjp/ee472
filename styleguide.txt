This is a poorly written and incomplete styleguide.  Feel free to change
this with your preferred style.  After project 0, this should not change.

This should serve to keep a consistent style between authors.

WHITESPACE:
  - no tabs, use spaces
  - tabstops at 2, eg

    int main() {
      if (x)
        do something;
    }

VARIABLE NAMES:
  - camel case, eg 'varName'

BLOCKS:
  - open curly braces on same line, eg

      int function() {
        // some function
      }

COMMENTS:
    - Multiline comments for functions, single line comments elsewhere

      /*
       * This function has some functionality
       */
      int function() {
        if (x)  // do something if x
          do something;
      }

      /* this function is private to this file */
      static int function() {
        int val = something;
        return val;   // return val
      }
