\section{Introduction}

The introductory lab contains 3 parts to introduce the students to different parts of working with the Stellaris embedded system. Part 1 of the lab gives the students a piece of sample code that will print a few numbers on an OLED screen on the Stellaris board. The lab asks the students to modify the code in a number of ways to implement the same code in a slightly different way. Examples of what the lab asks for are modifying the program to use function calls. Part 2 of the lab introduces the students to debugging their code that is currently running on the Stellaris board using the IAR program’s debugging capabilities. 2 programs with minor issues are provided to be run on the board while the debugger is being used to find and fix the problems. Finally for part 3 of the lab the students must use what they have learned from part 1 and 2 to create their own applications that will display messages on the OLED display on the Stellaris board. The 3 applications each involve blinking the characters A, B, C, and D in different patterns.

\subsection{A subsection}

Some more text and a table. \\

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \label{table:ex}
    \begin{tabular}{llr}
        \toprule
        Animal    & Description & Price (\$) \\
        \midrule
        Gnat      & per gram    & 13.65      \\

\subsubsection{A subsubsection}

Even more text. This shows that \LaTeX's figure positioning isn't perfect, and we'll have to work around it in some cases.
