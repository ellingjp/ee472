notes from peckol

measurement: measure only the specified number of times (or coninuously?) do
not dynamically update the measured value unless we decide to implement a scan
functionality

user command: cannot be check boxes. must be a textual command.

ack/nack: network deals with that. Must handle in underlying layers (e.g
resend, error message, etc)

RemoteTask: http server and ack/nack. + web page interface
fs_open: use to pass the text command to commandTask via a buffer. Then call
the commandTask. Depeding on desired functionality, may/may not need to
continuously refresh measurements
