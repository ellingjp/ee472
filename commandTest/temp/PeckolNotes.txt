notes from peckol

measurement: measure only the specified number of times (or coninuously?) do
not dynamically update the measured value unless we decide to implement a scan
functionality

user command: cannot be check boxes. must be a textual command.

ack/nack: network deals with that. Must handle in underlying layers (e.g
resend, error message, etc)

RemoteTask: http server and ack/nack. + web page interface
fs_open: use to pass the text command to commandTask via a buffer. Then call
the commandTask. Depeding on desired functionality, may/may not need to
continuously refresh measurements


Patrick's NTS:
reorder data/control flow so that:
	-	server -> command
	- command -> measure
	- measure -> compute
	-	measure -> ekgCapture
	- compute -> ekgProcess

measure will perform all measurements.
	- In the case of taking EKG measurements, it will start the EKGCapture task
	  (resuming it). ekgCaptureDone flag = false
	- Then measure will start the compute task. 
	- The Compute task will run EKGProcess if EKGCapture is run (according to
	  the global measurement selection). ekgcaptureDone flag = true
	-	When Compute is finished, it signals to Command that a measurement is done
		(via global measurementComplete flag).
